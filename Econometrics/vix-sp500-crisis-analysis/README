## 🔧 Methodology

### 1. LASSO Regression (Feature Selection)

**Purpose:** Identify which sentiment proxies significantly predict VIX movements

**Model Specification:**
```
VIX_t = β₀ + Σ(β_i × X_{i,t}) + ε_t

where X_i includes:
- S&P500 returns
- Market turnover  
- Trade volume
- Share of equity issuances
- Number of IPOs
- COVID lockdown dummy
```

**LASSO Objective Function:**
```
minimize: Σ(y_i - Σ(β_j × x_{ij}))² + λ × Σ|β_j|

where:
- λ = tuning parameter controlling shrinkage
- L1 penalty shrinks coefficients toward zero
- Non-significant variables have coefficients set to zero
```

**Implementation:**
- Cross-validation to select optimal λ
- Out-of-sample prediction testing
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) evaluation

### 2. Vector Autoregression (VAR)

**Purpose:** Analyze impulse response functions between VIX and sentiment proxies

**VAR Model:**
```
Y_t = A₁Y_{t-1} + A₂Y_{t-2} + ... + A_pY_{t-p} + ε_t

where:
- Y_t = [VIX_t, S&P500_t, Sentiment Variables]
- A_i = coefficient matrices
- p = optimal lag order
```

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- Serial correlation test
- Stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS)
- Granger causality tests

**Note:** VAR results showed serial correlation issues and were not included in final analysis.

### 3. DCC GJR-GARCH Model

**Purpose:** Model dynamic conditional correlation between VIX and S&P500 volatility

**GJR-GARCH(1,1) Specification:**

Univariate volatility equation:
```
σ²_t = ω + α × ε²_{t-1} + β × σ²_{t-1} + γ × I_{t-1} × ε²_{t-1}

where:
- σ²_t = conditional variance at time t
- ω = intercept (unconditional variance)
- α = ARCH parameter (impact of past shocks)
- β = GARCH parameter (persistence of volatility)
- γ = leverage effect (asymmetric volatility)
- I_{t-1} = indicator function (1 if ε_{t-1} < 0, else 0)
```

**Leverage Effect Interpretation:**
- γ = 0: Symmetric volatility
- γ > 0: Negative shocks increase volatility more than positive shocks
- γ < 0: Positive shocks increase volatility more (rare in equity markets)

**DCC Component:**

Dynamic correlation:
```
Q_t = (1 - a - b) × Q̄ + a × u_{t-1}u'_{t-1} + b × Q_{t-1}

R_t = diag(Q_t)^{-1/2} × Q_t × diag(Q_t)^{-1/2}

where:
- Q_t = conditional covariance matrix
- R_t = conditional correlation matrix
- a, b = DCC parameters
- u_t = standardized residuals
```

**Model Steps:**
1. Test for stationarity (ADF test)
2. Inspect volatility clustering
3. Test for ARCH effects (ARCH-LM test)
4. Estimate univariate GJR-GARCH(1,1) for each series
5. Estimate DCC parameters
6. Calculate conditional correlations over time
7. Compute minimum variance hedge ratio

## 📈 Key Findings & Results

### LASSO Regression Results

**Significant Variables Identified:**

| Variable | Coefficient | Significance |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **S&P500 Daily Returns** | Negative | *** |
| **Market Turnover** | Positive | *** |
| **Average Trade Volume** | Positive | ** |
| **Share of Equity Issuances** | Positive | ** |
| **Number of IPOs** | Negative | * |
| **COVID Lockdown Dummy** | Positive | *** |

**Model Performance:**
- Out-of-sample prediction MSE: **29.05**
- Successfully identified 6 significant sentiment factors
- COVID lockdown period had significant positive effect on VIX

**Key Insights:**
1. **Negative S&P500-VIX Relationship:** Confirmed inverse relationship - when S&P500 returns decline, VIX increases
2. **Turnover Effect:** Higher market turnover associated with increased volatility (panic trading)
3. **Lockdown Impact:** COVID border closures significantly elevated implied volatility
4. **IPO Effect:** More IPOs associated with lower VIX (market confidence signal)

### DCC GJR-GARCH Results

**Dynamic Conditional Correlation:**

**Average Correlation:** **-0.80** between VIX and S&P500 conditional variances

**Time-Varying Correlation Characteristics:**
- Correlation remains consistently negative throughout the sample period
- Strongest negative correlation (-0.85 to -0.90) during peak COVID uncertainty (March-April 2020)
- Slightly weaker correlation (-0.70 to -0.75) during recovery phases
- Correlation strengthens again during Russia-Ukraine conflict onset

**Leverage Effects (GJR-GARCH γ parameter):**
- **S&P500:** γ > 0 (significant) - Negative shocks increase volatility more than positive shocks
- **VIX:** γ > 0 (significant) - Bad news increases implied volatility asymmetrically
- Confirms asymmetric volatility in both series

**Volatility Persistence:**
- S&P500: α + β + 0.5γ ≈ 0.98 (high persistence)
- VIX: α + β + 0.5γ ≈ 0.95 (high persistence)
- Both series show strong volatility clustering

### Hedging Implications

**Hedge Ratio Calculation:**

Based on DCC results:
```
Optimal Hedge Ratio = ρ_{VIX,S&P500} × (σ_{S&P500} / σ_{VIX})

where:
- ρ = dynamic conditional correlation
- σ = conditional standard deviation
```

**Findings:**
1. **Strong Negative Correlation (-0.80)** confirms hedging potential
2. **Consistent Relationship:** Correlation remains stable across both crisis periods
3. **VIX Futures as Hedge:** Can be used to hedge S&P500 equity positions
4. **Hedge Effectiveness:** Approximately 64% variance reduction (ρ² = 0.64)

**Practical Application:**
- Long $1 million S&P500 → Short $800,000 VIX futures (approximate hedge ratio)
- Rebalancing required as correlation fluctuates
- More effective during high volatility periods
